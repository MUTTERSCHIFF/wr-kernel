        QEMU-mips-64 Board Support Package

1. About this document
======================

This document contains common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the qemumips64 layer
---------------------------
This layer and the wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd build/linux-windriver-<version>/linux
  # git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


3. Boot Instructions
====================

Since this BSP is targeted to a QEMU simulated board, run the command
below in the project directory to load the BSP on top of QEMU:

$ make start-target


3.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

By default, the guest system running in QEMU uses NFS rootfs.

3.2 RAM Root File System (initramfs)
---------------------------------

3.2.1 Create the initrd image
-----------------------------

Build the gzip'ed initramfs image with:

$ make bbs
$ bitbake wrlinux-image-initramfs
$ exit

The resulting file can be found at export/qemumips64-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz.


3.2.2 Deployment
----------------

Pass the run-time option "-initrd" in TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to use the
initramfs image as a ram disk, as shown in the example below.

Also, use the 'root=/dev/ram' kernel command line option. For example, run the following
command in the project directory to run the guest in QEMU using initrd:

$ make start-target \
TARGET_QEMU_OPTS="-initrd `pwd`/export/qemumips64-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz -M malta -bios mips_bios.bin" \
TARGET_QEMU_KERNEL_OPTS=root=/dev/ram

Note, We need to make use of TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to specify '-M <machine_type>' option 
for qemu. 


3.3 Virtual disk in QEMU
------------------------

3.3.1 Create virtual disk image
-------------------------------

Add the '--enable-bootimage=ext3' option when configuring the project with the 
configure command as shown below:

.../wrlinux/configure --enable-bootimage=ext3 \
--enable-kernel=standard+cfg/virtio.scc \
--enable-rootfs=glibc_small --enable-board=qemumips64 ...

Or:

edit <project-dir>/local.conf manually, ensuring that it contains the line below:

IMAGE_FSTYPES += "ext3"

Then run 'make fs' again. After 'make fs' completes, the virtual disk image will 
be located at:

<projectDir>/images/qemumips64-wrlinux-image-<rootfs type>-<kernel type>-dist.ext3

Eg. qemumips64-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.ext3

3.3.2 Related kernel options
----------------------------

Make sure the project is configured with:

	--enable-kernel=standard+cfg/virtio.scc


3.3.3 Deployment
----------------

Pass the command line option TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to QEMU, as shown:

 -drive if=virtio,file=<path to virtual disk image file>

And pass kernel command line options to the guest as shown:

 root=/dev/vda

For example, run the following command in the project directory:

$ make start-target \
TARGET_QEMU_OPTS=" -drive if=virtio,file=`pwd`/export/qemumips64-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.ext3" \
TARGET_QEMU_KERNEL_OPTS=root=/dev/vda


4. Target Notes
===============

4.1 OProfile
============
This BSP does not have a usable implementation of hardware performance
counters, so OProfile must be used in timer mode. If you are
using OProfile, you will need to add "oprofile.timer=1" to your kernel boot
options.

4.2 Memory Limit
================
It is possible to use up to 2047MiB of RAM, passing the memory map to the
kernel, adding a mem= argument to the append parameters as follow:
"mem=256m@0x0 mem=XXXm@0x90000000" where XXX represents the total memory
size minus 256MiB.
