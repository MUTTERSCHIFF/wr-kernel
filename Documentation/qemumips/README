        QEMU-mips Board Support Package

1. About this document
======================

This document contains common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the qemumips layer
---------------------------
This layer and the wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd build/linux-windriver-<version>/linux
  # git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


3. Boot Instructions
====================

Since this BSP is targeted to a QEMU simulated board, run the command
below in the project directory to run the BSP on top of QEMU:

$ make start-target


3.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

By default, the guest system running in QEMU uses NFS rootfs.

3.2 RAM Root File System (initramfs)
---------------------------------

3.2.1 Create the initrd image
-----------------------------

Build the gzip'd initramfs image with:

$ make bbs
$ bitbake wrlinux-image-initramfs
$ exit

The resulting file can be found at export/qemumips-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz


3.2.2 Deployment
----------------

Pass the run-time option "-initrd" in TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to use the
initramfs image as a ram disk, as shown in the example below.

Also, use the 'root=/dev/ram' kernel command line option. For example, run the following 
command in the project directory to run the Guest in QEMU using initrd:

$ make start-target \
TARGET_QEMU_OPTS="-initrd `pwd`/export/qemumips-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz -M malta -bios mips_bios.bin" \
TARGET_QEMU_KERNEL_OPTS=root=/dev/ram

Note: We need to make use of TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to specify '-M <machine_type>' option 
for qemu. 


3.3 Virtual disk in QEMU
------------------------

3.3.1 Create virtual disk image
-------------------------------

Add the '--enable-bootimage=ext3' option when configuring the project with the 
configure command as shown below:

.../wrlinux/configure --enable-bootimage=ext3 \
--enable-kernel=standard+cfg/virtio.scc \
--enable-rootfs=glibc_small --enable-board=qemumips ...

Or:

Edit <project-dir>/local.conf manually, ensuring that it contains the line below:

IMAGE_FSTYPES += "ext3"

Then run 'make fs' again. After 'make fs' completes, you can find the virtual
disk image at:

<project-dir>/images/qemumips-wrlinux-image-<rootfs type>-<kernel type>-dist.ext3

Eg. qemumips-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.ext3

3.3.2 Related kernel options
----------------------------

Make sure the project is configured with the following argument to the configure
command:

	--enable-kernel=standard+cfg/virtio.scc


3.3.3 Deployment
----------------

Pass the command line option TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to QEMU as shown:

 -drive if=virtio,file=<path to virtual disk image file>

And pass kernel command line options to the guest as shown:

 root=/dev/vda

For example, run the following command within the project directory:

$ make start-target \
TARGET_QEMU_OPTS=" -drive if=virtio,file=`pwd`/export/qemumips-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.ext3" \
TARGET_QEMU_KERNEL_OPTS=root=/dev/vda


4. Target Notes
===============

4.1 OProfile
============
This BSP does not have a usable implementation of hardware performance
counters, so OProfile must be used in timer mode. If you are
using OProfile you need to add "oprofile.timer=1" to your kernel boot
options.

4.2 Memory Limit
================
Memory size is limited to 256MiB with a 32-bit kernel.

4.3 QEMU GDB Backend
====================
QEMU only maps MIPS TLBs at certain times, making virtual address
mapping unreliable. To work around this behavior, it is recommended that
you either build module code into the kernel or make use of KGDBoE
to debug kernel modules.
