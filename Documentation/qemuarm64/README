        QEMU-ARM64 Board Support Package

1. About this document
======================

This document contains common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the qemuarm64 layer
----------------------------
This layer and the wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd build/linux-windriver-<version>/linux
  # git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


3. Boot Instructions
====================

Since this BSP is targeted at a QEMU simulated board, run the command
below in the project directory to run the BSP on top of QEMU:

$ make start-target


3.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

By default, the guest system running in QEMU runs NFS rootfs.


3.2 RAM Root File System (initramfs)
------------------------------------

3.2.1 Create the initrd image
-----------------------------

Build the gzip'd initramfs image with:

$ make wrlinux-image-initramfs

The resulting file can be found at export/qemuarm64-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz

3.2.2 Deployment
----------------

Pass the run-time option "-initrd" in TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to use the
initramfs image as a ram disk, as shown in the example below.

And use the 'root=/dev/ram' kernel command line option. For example, run the following
command in the project directory to run the guest in QEMU using initrd:

$ make start-target \
TARGET_QEMU_OPTS="-initrd `pwd`/export/qemuarm64-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz -M vrit -cpu cortex-a57" \
TARGET_QEMU_KERNEL_OPTS=root=/dev/ram

Note: We need to make use of TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to specify '-M virt -cpu <cpu_type>' option
for qemu.


3.3 Virtual disk in QEMU
------------------------

virtio net and blk is enabled by default
Make sure IMAGE_FSTYPES contains ext3 which gets ext3 rootfs built

$ qemu-system-aarch64 \
-machine virt -cpu cortex-a57 -nographic -smp 1 -m 2G \
-kernel tmp/deploy/images/qemuarm64/Image \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=disk0 \
-drive index=0,id=disk0,file=tmp/deploy/images/qemuarm64/wrlinux-image-glibc-small-qemuarm64.ext3 \
-device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0 \
-netdev user,id=net0 \
-append "console=ttyAMA0,38400 root=/dev/vda"
