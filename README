wr-kernel: Wind River kernel layer
----------------------------------

This layer:

  - adds core kernel support on top of linux-yocto for boards supported by
    Wind River
  - contains packages that are coupled to the kernel version
  - contains task sets and configurations related to the kernel
  - includes the nested 'kernel-dev' layer for local clones and externalsrc
    development
  - includes a series of basic QEMU BSPs.  For more information, see the
    Documentation/<machine> directory.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on openembedded-core, wr-base, wr-template and
meta-networking layers which are supplied with Wind River Linux.

This layer recommends the wr-kernel-dl layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the wr-kernel layer
----------------------------
This layer and a corresponding BSP layer should be added to bblayers.conf.

Note: The linux-yocto* recipes are superseded by the linux-windriver*
recipes when using this layer.  The linux-yocto* recipes are disabled
to avoid confusion.

You will need to specify the kernel type to build.  This is done using the
kernel type enabled variable KTYPE_ENABLED.  The value of this variable is
specific to the BSP you have configured, see the BSP for a list of supported
kernel types, TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES.

Alternatively you can disable the machine validation by manually
setting the following in your local.conf:

   COMPATIBLE_MACHINE_mybsp = "mybsp"

Where mybsp is the machine you have configured.  This is not the
recommended configuration.
